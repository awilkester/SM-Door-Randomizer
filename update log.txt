Future plans
	-Add backtracking features.
	-Refine item randomization.
	-Learn to create GUI to make the entire thing less cumbersome.

v0.3a
	-Added item randomization! Currently in beta testing.
		-you can shuffle items!
		-you can control the ratio of common items.
		-you can control the amount of unique items.
		-you can control the pickup values.
		-removed some rooms from the shuffle list.

v0.2
	-Removed the Gravity Suit one-way exit from the global shuffle to prevent impossible situations (the door can never be opened from the left!)
	-Removed the Maridia Tunnel from the shuffles (game glitches out if they are disconnected from their default setup.)
	-Added custom local percentages.
	-Changed local shuffling rules so item rooms cannot break them (item rooms always backtrack in local shuffle regardless of setting.)
	-Header detection added: The program will determine the header size, and renormalize the ROM to have the correct header.
	-Seeding added: Every successful ROM creation will output a seed, which can be used to regenerate the ROM exactly in this program!
